##### Tried and true Haskell functions for use in Javascript

.oO( or at least as close as we can get )

This project uses a combination of:

* [Flow types](https://flowtype.org/)
* [type-of](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/type-of)

and some functional magic to provide a set of functions closely mimicking the
libraries provided by Haskell.

I keep track of weird compatibility issues in [my notes](/notes.md).
